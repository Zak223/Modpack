After obtaining Modularium from [[Modular Machinery]] Players can create the Steam Boiler

This High Tier Boiler makes the pain of generating steam a thing of the past! 

Players will need to add Coal and Water to get a huge steam output!

This should power a lot of steam machines on its own, but once players get into LV they might want to expand their options.
